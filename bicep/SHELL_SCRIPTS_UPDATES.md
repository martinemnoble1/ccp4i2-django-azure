# Shell Scripts Updates for Private VNet Architecture

## Summary of Changes

The shell scripts have been updated to work correctly with the new private VNet architecture. Here are the key changes made:

## üîß **Updated Scripts**

### 1. `deploy-infrastructure.sh`
**Key Changes:**
- **Temporary Key Vault Access**: Temporarily enables public access to store initial secrets, then disables it
- **Secret Storage**: Stores PostgreSQL password, ACR credentials, and Django secret key during infrastructure deployment
- **Enhanced Output**: Shows Key Vault name and security status

**Security Flow:**
```bash
1. Deploy infrastructure with private endpoints
2. Temporarily enable Key Vault public access
3. Store all required secrets (DB password, ACR password, Django secret)
4. Disable Key Vault public access
5. Infrastructure is now fully private
```

### 2. `deploy-applications.sh`
**Key Changes:**
- **Removed Key Vault Access**: No longer tries to access Key Vault (secrets already stored)
- **Network Validation**: Checks private endpoints and VNet integration status
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Shows security features and private network status

**Validation Checks:**
- Private endpoints provisioning status
- VNet integration for Container Apps Environment
- Security confirmation for all services

### 3. `build-and-push.sh`
**Key Changes:**
- **Removed nginx Build**: No longer builds unused nginx image
- **Simplified Process**: Only builds server and web images for Container Apps

### 4. `deploy-master.sh`
**Key Changes:**
- **Updated Documentation**: Reflects private VNet architecture
- **Security Messaging**: Emphasizes enterprise-grade security
- **Enhanced Instructions**: Better next steps and monitoring guidance

## üîí **Security Improvements**

### Before (Public Architecture)
```
Developer Machine ‚Üí Public Key Vault ‚Üí Store Secrets
Container Apps ‚Üí Public PostgreSQL ‚Üí Database Access
Container Apps ‚Üí Public Storage ‚Üí File Access
```

### After (Private Architecture)
```
Developer Machine ‚Üí Temporary Public Access ‚Üí Store Secrets ‚Üí Disable Public Access
Container Apps ‚Üí Private Endpoint ‚Üí PostgreSQL (Private IP)
Container Apps ‚Üí Private Endpoint ‚Üí Storage (Private IP)
Container Apps ‚Üí Private Endpoint ‚Üí Key Vault (Private IP)
```

## üöÄ **Deployment Flow**

### Step 1: Infrastructure Deployment
```bash
./scripts/deploy-infrastructure.sh
```
- Creates VNet with subnets and NSGs
- Deploys all services with private endpoints
- Temporarily allows Key Vault access to store secrets
- Disables public access to Key Vault
- Creates private DNS zones for name resolution

### Step 2: Image Building
```bash
./scripts/build-and-push.sh
```
- Logs into private Container Registry
- Builds server and web images
- Pushes to private registry via ACR build

### Step 3: Application Deployment
```bash
./scripts/deploy-applications.sh
```
- Deploys Container Apps with VNet integration
- Sets up RBAC for Key Vault access
- Validates private network configuration
- Reports security status

## üîç **Validation Features**

The updated scripts now validate:
- **Private Endpoints**: Confirms all private endpoints are provisioned
- **VNet Integration**: Verifies Container Apps are VNet-integrated
- **Security Status**: Reports on private access configuration
- **Network Health**: Checks infrastructure subnet configuration

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Benefits**

### Enterprise-Grade Protection
- **Zero Public Attack Surface**: No services exposed to internet
- **Network Isolation**: All traffic within private VNet
- **Encrypted Communication**: SSL/TLS over private network
- **Identity-Based Access**: RBAC for all service access

### Compliance Features
- **Audit Trail**: All access through Azure Monitor
- **Data Residency**: Traffic stays within Azure region
- **Network Controls**: NSGs and private endpoints
- **Access Management**: Managed identities and RBAC

## üìù **Important Notes**

### Key Vault Access Pattern
The scripts use a **temporary public access** pattern for initial secret storage:
1. This is only during deployment from your local machine
2. Public access is immediately disabled after secret storage
3. Container Apps access Key Vault via private endpoints only
4. This approach maintains security while enabling automation

### Network Validation
The scripts now validate the private network setup:
- Confirms private endpoints are working
- Verifies VNet integration
- Reports security status
- Provides troubleshooting information

### Container Registry Access
- Images are built using `az acr build` (server-side builds)
- No need for Docker daemon on deployment machine
- All image pulls happen via private endpoints
- Registry credentials stored securely in Key Vault

## üîÑ **Migration Path**

If you have an existing public deployment:
1. **Backup Data**: Export any critical data from existing deployment
2. **Run New Deployment**: Use the updated scripts for fresh private deployment
3. **Migrate Data**: Import data to new private infrastructure
4. **Validate Security**: Confirm all private endpoints are working
5. **Clean Up**: Remove old public resources

The updated scripts ensure your CCP4i2 deployment now uses enterprise-grade security with private network isolation while maintaining all functionality!
